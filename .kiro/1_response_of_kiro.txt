I'll create a modern password strength checker with all your 
requirements plus some additional features. Let me build this 
in the password-checker folder.


Now let me create a sample common_passwords.txt file with 
common passwords for the dictionary check:


Perfect! I've created a modern password strength checker with 
all your requirements and more. Here's what I included:

✅ Animated strength meter bar (weak/fair/good/strong)
✅ Strength label with color coding
✅ Estimated crack time display
✅ Dictionary check using common_passwords.txt


Additional Features:

Real-time requirement validation with checkmarks/crosses
Checks for: length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and common passwords
Smooth animations and transitions
Responsive design for mobile devices

Just open password-checker/index.html in your browser to see 
it in action. The dictionary check will work automatically 
if the common_passwords.txt file is in the same directory.
