You're right! The scoring logic needs to be fixed. A password
 should never be "Strong" if it doesn't meet the minimum 
 8-character requirement. Let me fix the scoring algorithm:


Fixed! Now the password checker will:

1. Always show "Too Short" if the password is less than 
    8 characters, regardless of other criteria
2. Only calculate the full score once the 8-character minimum 
    is met
3. Adjusted the scoring thresholds to be more realistic 
    (now requires higher scores for "Strong")
4. Added penalty for common passwords


Try it now - short passwords like "a@2A" will correctly show 
as "Too Short" and "Weak" instead of "Strong".
